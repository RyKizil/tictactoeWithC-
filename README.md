# tictactoeWithCSharp
A simple and fun tic-tac-to game in cmd prompt where 2 human players play against each other taking turns and placing the pieces using the keyboard number 1-9 where 1 stands for the bottom-left and 9 for the upper-right. AI will be added later using the min-max algorithm where the player can take it up against the (unbeatable) computer.
